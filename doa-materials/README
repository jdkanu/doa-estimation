Contents in this folder:

houses.csv - contains dimensions of each rectangular house. Houses are named by number and saved in .obj format as input for simulator.

Ambisonic_houses/ - this folder contains all randomly sampled listener source pairs in each room. Each line in each .prs file uses two 3-D 	vectors to represents the a pair in that house. Note that according to acoustic reciprocity, source listener pair locations can be exchanged without affecting the IR. Simulation outputs have the naming convention {house_id}-pair{pair_id}.wav

labels.csv - contains our training label.

Ambisonic_houses_IR_rt60.csv - contains reverberation time (second) for each simulated pair. This is computed based on 4 ambisonic channels.
